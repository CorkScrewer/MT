MT (Mega Tile)
==============

### A bit about the game
MT is a game made in java and libGDX. Right now, it is in the early stage of development.
It is made for desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux, Solaris). I don't think that I would build for android.
But, no promises.

### This project now
Yeah, it ded. Im currently working on an rpg which you can find on my github, but im not committing. simply because i have the project files distributed among the editor, the game, and the engine. So, I'm still working on it, just not committing :)

### END OF README

Alright, I think that's all!
